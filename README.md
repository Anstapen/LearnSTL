# LearnSTL
This repo contains a C++ console application with a few exercises.
You can use them to check your knowledge about the Standard Template Library's algorithms and other c++ features like ranges and concepts.
The exercises are mainly about using algorithms on STL containers - mostly vector - and also other knowledge related to new C++ 20 features.
If you would like to get the (possible) solutions for each exercise, please contact me at github@stapenhorst.io
