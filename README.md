# LearnSTL
This repo contains a C++ console application with a few exercises.
You can use them to check your knowledge about the Standard Template Library's algorithms and other c++ features like ranges and concepts.
The exercises are mainly about using algorithms on STL containers - mostly vector - and also other knowledge related to new C++ 20 features.
If you would like to get the (possible) solutions for each exercise, please contact me at github@stapenhorst.io

### IDE
I used the Visual Studio 2022 IDE to create the examples but I hope the ode works in other IDEs just fine.

When opening the solution in Visual Studio the first time, you should collaps all the regions so you get an idea of the code structure.
It will look something like this:

It helps you to navigate through the different sections.
