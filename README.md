# LearnSTL
This repo contains a C++ console application with a few exercises.
You can use them to check your knowledge about the Standard Template Library's algorythms.
The exercises are mainly about using algorythms on STL containers - mostly vector.
If you would like to get the (possible) solutions for each exercise, please contact me.
